# Item38: Model "has-a" or "is-implemented-in-terms-of" through composition

### Composition is the relationship between types that arises when objects of one type contain objects of another type.

### Among programmers, the term composition also knowns as layering, containment, aggregation and embedding.

### Composition means either "has-a" or "is-implemented-in-terms-of".

### Composition has meanings completely different from that of public inheritance.

### In the application domain(real world objects modeling), composition means has-a. In the implementation domain(purely implementation artifects), it means is-implemented-in-terms-of.

### Reuse is a wonderful thing.

### Better be familiar with standard library and data structures

### std::list<T> represents collections of objects with duplicates. But std::set<T> without duplicates.

### Set can be implemented in terms of list. Set is-not-a list!
